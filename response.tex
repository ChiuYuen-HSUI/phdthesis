\section{Requested Changes}

\subsection{Figures}
\question{Increase the line width used in the figures like Figure 3.4.\\}
\action{All figures have been inspected and improved. At most places, the minimum line width has been increased to $0.75\mathrm{pt}$. At some places, markers and annotations have been added to easy identification of the different graphs.}

\subsection{Assumptions}
\question{Make a list of assumptions, especially in Chapter 2, under which the work is valid}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \says{TM}{In the thesis, the focus is on resonant systems. It would be good to add some comments in perspective of a general system identification.}
\item \says{JA}{In (2.12), you have a series of second-order systems that all have the same amplitude. Can this be made more general?}
\item \says{KT}{For the input design, in (2.1), you assume that the noise is white. What happens for colored noise? The reason I ask this is in case you want to estimate the best linear approximation of a nonlinear system. Then you can consider the stochastic nonlinear distortions as a noise source, but that is not necessarily white.}
\TODO{Address iterative design in Chapter 2.}
%\A I assumed white noise, as it is the most basic assumption you can make. If the noise is not white, then you can include the coloring of the noise in the amplitude spectrum, but then you need to know the noise (properties) beforehand. If you don't know the noise beforehand, you can use a parametric noise model and optimize.\\}
  \item \says{TM}{For the robust excitation signals, you use the setup of Goodwin and coworkers. On slide 17, you focus on variance. Why not on bias?}
               \says{TM}{Why can you guarantee \replace{that}{unbiasedness of your estimators}?}
               \TODO{address this}\oldnewpage{x}{y}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{References}
\question{Update the (historical) references.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\oldnewpage{51}{?}
\says{TM}{In Chapter~3: Did the problem of FRF modeling start in 1995? How long does the problem date back?  I would suggest to add a few historical references, older than 1995.}
 \TODO{References have been added to Chapter 3: \ldots}
\item 
\oldnewpage{119}{?}
\says{TM}{The initialization of the parametric estimators is an interesting expos\'e. The references have a narrow flavor. There are more people that worked on this, other than Ljung.}
\action{More (historical) references for parametric estimates and initial values have been added.}
\begin{oldquote}
Parametric identification of \gls{LTI} systems from either input/output data or non-parametric frequency response data, has been well developed as evidenced by published literature~\citep{Pintelon2012,Ljung1999,Schoukens1999,Pintelon1998}.

\end{enumerate}

  \TODO{Robustness has been defined}\oldnewpage{}{y}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Small Corrections}
\question{A list of small corrections will be provided directly by the members of the jury.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item A lot of typos and other tiny adjustments have been carried out.
To keep this document short, you can consult commits
  \commit{eed3f40}, 
  \commit{b163710}, 
  \commit{08d2bfb},  
  \commit{dc1d99d}, 
  \commit{06471dd}, 
  \commit{d4771ea}, and
  \commit{ca38442} where most of these small changes are contained.

\item \action{The bibliography has been made more uniform. Whenever possible, first names have been included.}

\item \says{TM}{When considering unstable LTI systems, which methods will make sense when doing truncation?}
\answer{The truncation methods are not directly usable for that situation.}
\action{A short discussion has been added to the future work section.}
\oldnewsection{}{6.2.2}
\begin{newquote}
    With respect to the impulse response truncation approaches introduced in Section~3.6, a few paths could be investigated further to broaden the class of systems where these methods are applicable and have a more subtle smoothing behavior of the transfer function.

    The crude truncation approach that is discussed in this thesis, can be interpreted as equivalent to windowing the \gls{IRF} with a rectangular window.
    In the frequency domain, this causes a very obvious correlation in the \gls{FRF}.
    By choosing a different window function (e.g. an exponential window, Hann window, \ldots), one could try to reduce this adverse effect.

   Another alternative for this crude rectangular windowing approach, which still uses a \gls{DFT} for the full size of the measurement record, could be to reduce the size of the \gls{DFT}.
   The introduced algorithms that determine a truncation length $\truncTime$, could also give a good indication of what size of \gls{DFT} would be suitable to represent the system well for the given measurements.
   However, further studies are required to compare the performance of these different alternatives.

   Currently, the truncation approach works based on the assumption that the last fragment of the \gls{IRF} is dominated by noise influences.
   The consequence of this is that the system is assumed to be stable and causal.
   It would be a worthwhile extension to relax this assumption to deal with unstable systems as well.
   For those systems, the last fragment of the \gls{IRF} will be dominated by the unstable (or anti-causal) part of the system. 
   Hence, the problem will become much harder to deal with, since a segment in the middle of the \gls{IRF} needs to be found where the noise level can be estimated.
   Afterwards, one could try to split up the \gls{IRF} in a part attributed to the stable poles and one caused by unstable poles and apply truncation on both parts separately and recombining the results.
\end{newquote}

\item \says{JA}{On page 33, in (2.62), you have a covariance matrix. The PSD of the noise depends on the frequency. Afterwards, it is assumed constant?}\oldnewpage{33}{?}
\action{}
\item \says{JA}{With the logarithmic spacing of the multisine, you assume a specific type of damping (all $\xi$ are the same). 
So, the FRF shapes are the same on a logarithmic scale. What if you have other shapes?}
\answer{
The assumption is not that $\xi$ is identical for all subsystems. 
Rather, when $\xi \geq \xi_{\min}$ for all subsystems, their relative $3\unit{dB}$ bandwidth has a minimal width and is excited well when $\alpha \leq 1 + \xi_{\min}$ (see also Figure 2.8 in the manuscript: for all $\frac{\alpha -1}{\xi_{\min}} < 1$, misalignment is no longer an issue and hence the design works well).
}
\item \says{JA}{Here, the number of modes per frequency band decreases as the frequency increases. A decreasing modal density is typical for a beam, but for a plate, the number of modes is constant. For a volume, the number of modes increases. I suggest to recast the context in a set of assumptions. The modal density and the modal overlap factor are important in this respect.
But this also opens perspectives. For a beam, you would get a logarithmic multisine, for a plate, you would get a linear multisine. In mechanics, you have an idea about the modal density and modal overlap factor, which can be a big prior knowledge.}
\item \says{JA}{Below (3.17), $V$ is assumed to be i.i.d., but the noise is filtered by $A$. I suggest to change the assumption.}
\item \says{JA}{On page 129, in (5.17), the probability is zero. You need some interpretation of the equality sign.}
\oldnewpage{129}{?}
\action{The equality sign has been replaced by an approximate equality.}
\begin{oldquote}
The success rate $\successRate_{\bullet}$ of an initialization scheme $\bullet$ is expressed mathematically as the probability function
\begin{equation}
\successRate_{\bullet} = 
  \Prob{  \model{\bullet}=\model{\trueSymbol}  }
\text{.}
\tag{5.17}
\end{equation}
In practice, and since the iterative algorithm usually does not reach the local optimum precisely, the above definition is relaxed to the form
\begin{equation}
\successRate_{\bullet} \isdef \Prob{ \norm[2]{\model{\bullet} - \model{\trueSymbol}} < \absoluteTolerance}
\tag{5.18}
\end{equation}
with $\absoluteTolerance$ a numerical tolerance that will be specified later on.
\end{oldquote}

\begin{newquote}
The success rate $\successRate_{\bullet}$ of an initialization scheme $\bullet$ is defined as the probability that it reaches the \emph{best local optimum}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\successRate_{\bullet} = 
  \Prob{  \model{\bullet} \approx \model{\trueSymbol}  }
\text{.}
\tag{5.17}
\end{equation}
In practice, and since the iterative algorithm usually does not reach the local optimum precisely, the above definition is implemented practically as

\tag{5.18}
\end{equation}
with $\absoluteTolerance$ a numerical tolerance that will be specified later on.
\end{newquote}

\item \says{BP}{Guideline 2.3 seems to be dropped further in the text.}
\TODO{This guideline has been placed into context in the book.}
\begin{newquote}
  \TODO{add quote}
\end{newquote}

\item 
\says{BP}{In Chapter 5, you use LPM and not LRM? Why? From Chapter 3, you concluded that LRM performs better.}
\answer{LPM is better at lower SNR. Also, chronologically, Chapter 5 is older that Chapter 3. I checked the results with LRM, but they are very similar to the LPM results, since I used low SNR settings. There is a remark in the text.}
\says{TM}{The remark is a bit late in the thesis.}
\oldnewpage{x}{y}
\TODO{The remark has been moved to an earlier place in the text.}

\item
\says{JD}{I work in electrochemistry. I use multisines to characterize Warburg impedances in $\sqrt{\omega}$ and other elements in $\sqrt[x]{\omega}$. Will LPM still work for this?}
\answer{The LPM will only provide an approximation for those applications.}
\action{A paragraph has been added to the future work section.}
\oldnewpage{}{?}
\begin{newquote}
E.g. in electrochemistry it is common~\citep{Wang1987} to describe diffusion phenomena using Warburg impedances which are proportional to $\sqrt{s}$ (with $s$ the Laplace variable).
    On the other hand, in microwave engineering~\citep{Rizzi1988,Pozar2005}, commensurate filters are easily described using Richard's variable $R=\tanh (\tau s)$ with $\tau$ the delay of the considered transmission lines.
    For these altered models, however, it should be verified whether numerical conditioning becomes a similar nuisance as for discrete-time models.
\end{newquote}

 \item \says{JD}{In electrochemistry, I work in frequency ranges from 0.01 Hz until 100 kHz. In the 1970s I already used an arithmetic spacing of my excited frequencies. What is the relationship with logarithmic multisines? Was my intuition right back then? Or is it a reinvention of the wheel?}
\TODO{A remark has been added}

\item \action{Equation (2.6) has been rewritten and clarified}
\oldnewpage{15}{?}
\begin{newquote}
From (2.4) and (2.5) we see that scaling the optimal input power by $1-\delta$, has the following effect on the variance of the estimate:
\begin{align}
\var{\hat{G}(j\omega)}_{{(1-\delta)\mathrm{optimal} + \delta \mathrm{robust}}} \approx \frac{1}{1-\delta} \var{\hat{G}(j\omega)}_{\mathrm{optimal}}
\tag{2.6}
\text{.}
\end{align}
This is a small loss while the increase in robustness can be significant if the added signal is robust.

  }
  
  \item

  \says{JA}{For (3.86), you cite Seber and Lee, 2003, but Golub was earlier. I suggest to change the reference.}
  \action{A reference to Golub has been added. Seber and Lee, however, provide a more elaborate proof such that I think their work still deserves to be mentioned.}
  \begin{newquote}
 	For linear models (i.e. $\LocalVector{Y} = \LocalMatrix{K} \LocalVector{\theta}$, such as for the {LRM} and {LPM}), however, the {PRESS} can be calculated in a single step without estimating any additional models~\citep{Golub1979}:
	\begin{equation}
	\PRESS = \frac{\LocalVector{E}^{\HT} \LocalVector{W}^{-1} \LocalVector{E}}{2N_W + 1}
         \tag{3.86}
	\end{equation}
	where $\LocalVector{E}$ is the residual vector of the full estimation and $\LocalVector{W}$ is a diagonal weighting matrix with $\LocalVector{W}_{ii} = (1 - \LocalVector{H}_{ii})^{\HT} (1 - \LocalVector{H}_{ii})$ and
	$\LocalVector{H} = \LocalMatrix{K} \pinv{\LocalMatrix{K}}$ is the so-called `hat-matrix' that is known to be idempotent.
	The proof for this can also be found in \citet[Sec.~12.3.2]{Seber2003}.

\item 
\oldnewpage{73}{?}
\action{Constant versus varying local model complexity has been clarified.}
\begin{oldquote}
In the previous section, different methods were introduced to select the local model order. 
This begs the question whether it is advantageous to use the same local model complexity over all frequencies or the model order should be kept globally. 
The answer to this, depends on the ultimate purpose of the \gls{FRF}.
