\opening{Dear jury members,}

First of all, I would like to thank you for your feedback on my PhD thesis and the ensuing discussions.
This has greatly improved the text.

Attached, you can find an extensive summary of the changes I have carried out in the text.
\oldnew{old}{new}
The numbers in the margin indicate the pages in the old revision (\href{https://github.com/egeerardyn/phdthesis/releases/tag/private-submit}{\texttt{946aebc}} as for the private defense) and in the new revision.

I have also made the \LaTeX{} source code of my text (and data files) available on GitHub.
There, you can inspect the \href{https://github.com/egeerardyn/phdthesis/compare/b6b273e...master}{full set of changes} at the source code level, or \href{https://github.com/egeerardyn/phdthesis/commits/master}{inspect individual changes}.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\encl{list of changes\\

\section{Requested Changes}

\subsection{Figures}
\question{Increase the line width used in the figures like Figure 3.4}
\action{All figures have been inspected and improved. At most places, the minimum line width has been increased to $0.75\mathrm{pt}$.}

\subsection{Assumptions}
\question{Make a list of assumptions, especially in Chapter 2, under which the work is valid}

\subsection{References}
\question{Update the (historical) references.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \says{TM}{In Chapter~3: Did the problem of FRF modeling start in 1995? How long does the problem date back?  I would suggest to add a few historical references, older than 1995.}
\item \TODO{References have been added to Chapter 3: \ldots}
\item \says{TM}{The initialization of the parametric estimators is an interesting expos\'e. The references have a narrow flavor. There are more people that worked on this, other than Ljung.}
\item \TODO{References have been added to Chapter 5: \ldots}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Define robustness}
\question{Define robustness.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \says{JA}{The use of the word ``robustness'' can have different meanings. What is the meaning of ``robustness of input''?}
  \item \says{JA}{I suggest that you define ``robustness'' in the thesis.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Small Corrections}
\question{A list of small corrections will be provided directly by the members of the jury.}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \says{TM}{In the thesis, the focus is on resonant systems. It would be good to add some comments in perspective of a general system identification.}
 \item \says{TM}{In Section~3.2, you have a very brief overview of the terms that show up, but no mathematical derivation of how these terms look like. I suggest to add something there.}
\item \says{TM}{When considering unstable LTI systems, which methods will make sense when doing truncation?}
 \TODO{A remark considering instability has been added to the manuscript for the truncation}

\item \says{JA}{In (2.12), you have a series of second-order systems that all have the same amplitude. Can this be made more general? But \replace{it}{choosing equal amplitudes} has consequences for the results.}
\item \TODO{A remark has been added to clarify this}
\end{itemize}

\section{Other Changes}

\begin{itemize}
\item The bibliography has been made more uniform
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Changes}
The following minor changes are not yet completed, but will be performed for the final version.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \TODO{Improve pagination, and check for widows and orphans.}
  \item \TODO{Add the cover to the source.}
  \item \TODO{Request an ISBN and add it to the source.}
  \item \TODO{Add the DOI for the final PDF.}
\end{itemize}
