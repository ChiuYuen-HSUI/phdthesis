  abstract = {This paper describes the ``fractional Fourier transform,'' which admits
	computation by an algorithm that has complexity proportional to the
	fast Fourier transform algorithm. Whereas the discrete Fourier transform
	(DFT) is based on integral roots of unity $e^{- 2 \pi i/n}$, the
	fractional Fourier transform is based on fractional roots of unity
	$e^{-2 \pi i \alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is arbitrary. The fractional
	Fourier transform and the corresponding fast algorithm are useful
	for such applications as computing DFTs of sequences with prime lengths,
	computing DFTs of sparse sequences, analyzing sequences with noninteger
	periodicities, performing high-resolution trigonometric interpolation,
	detecting lines in noisy images, and detecting signals with linearly
	drifting frequencies. In many cases, the resulting algorithms are
	faster by arbitrarily large factors than conventional techniques.},

  abstract = {The characterization of biological materials and systems using electrical
	impedance spectroscopy has traditionally been performed using the
	frequency sweep technique. When applied to in-vivo measurements,
	the movement induced modulation has often a period shorter than the
	sweep time. This drawback can be overcome using broadband signal
	bursts. Given that the energy amount to be injected to the biological
	material is limited for safety reasons, the best choice is the use
	of multisine signals, which concentrate all that energy in the measurement
	frequencies, then achieving an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. The
	uniform distribution of frequencies is not adequate due to the system
	nonlinearities and to the need of covering a three-decade frequency
	range. This work is concerned with the design of a quasilogarithmic
	multisine with a similar number of frequencies at each decade and
	with a safety band around each measurement frequency. This band will
	be free of harmonics and quadratic intermodulation products. The
	system has been implemented using a virtual instrument based on an
	arbitrary waveform generator, a digital oscilloscope and an analog
	frontend. The system has been validated using passive RC networks
	and has been applied to the in-vivo characterization of infarcted
	myocardium in pigs}
