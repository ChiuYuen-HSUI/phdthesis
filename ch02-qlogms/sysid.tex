\section{Introduction}\label{sec:excitation:sysid2012:intro}




% \section{Simulations}\label{sec:excitation:sim}
% We considered a linear second order system that is to be identified, with the
% only prior knowledge that its resonance frequency $\fR$ lies in a known
% frequency band that may span several decades. 
% Our goal is to identify such a system by means of a single excitation signal, 
% such that the frequency response function (FRF) of the second order systems that are
% equally damped are identified with the same uncertainty near their resonance.

% \subsection{Excitation}
% To excite the system under test, we used quasi-logarithmic (quasi-log) random-phase multisines. 
% Their phase spectrum $\psi_{k}$ is the result of a uniform random process over $[0,2\pi[$.
% A logarithmic spacing of the frequency components causes each decade within the band of interest to contain the same number of frequency components.

% The quasi-log multisines were sampled at $f_s = 65\,536 \unit{Hz}$
% and consisted of $N= 65\,536$ points such that the frequency spacing was $f_0 = 1\unit{Hz}$ for the linear grid.
% This allowed the signal to cover four decades in the frequency domain,
% from which we did not use the first decade.
% Only frequencies between $1\unit{Hz}$ and $16\,384\unit{Hz}$ are excited, such that aliasing was avoided.

% For the quasi-log excitation, a frequency ratio of $\alpha = 1.05$ was chosen
% and the amplitude spectrum was kept constant $A_k = A_{\mathrm{in}}$. This
% amplitude was normalized such that the root mean square (RMS) value of $u[n]$
% was equal to $1$.

% The desired frequency ratio $\alpha$ may not be attainable for low frequencies,  due to a lack of frequency resolution.
% This causes a less dense coverage of the lowest frequency bands.

% \subsection{System under test}
% The systems we studied are low-pass second order systems with a given damping
% $\damping$, resonance frequency $\fR$ and a DC gain of $0 \unit{dB}$. Such systems
% can be represented in the discrete frequency domain by a transfer
% function of the form:
% \begin{equation}
%   G \left( z \right) = \frac{         b_2  z^{2} + b_1 z + b_0}%
%                             {\phantom{a_2} z^{2} + a_1 z + a_0}
%   \text{.}
%   \label{eq:excitation:tf}
% \end{equation}

% These discrete-time systems were constructed using the \matlab\ function \texttt{cheby1}.

% An output error (OE) model was used to describe the system under test with the
% input $u[n]$, the system output $y_0[n]$, the white noise source $e[n]$
% and the measured output $y[n] = y_0[n] + e[n]$.

% \subsection{Simulation setup}
% First, we considered a system with damping $\damping=0.05$ and resonant
% frequency $\fR = 40 \unit{Hz}$.

% The output noise $e[n]$ was white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation
% $\sigma_e = 0.1123$ which was approximately $10$ times smaller than the
% root mean square (RMS) value $y_0[n]$.

% The simulations were repeated $R=1000$ times for each system with different realizations of the multisines $u[n]$ and the noise $e[n]$.
% In order to avoid that all simulations started with zero initial conditions, $N + N_{\mathrm{trans}}$ data points were generated, from which the first $N_{\mathrm{trans}}$ points of each simulation were discarded. 

% \subsection{Results for a single system}
% The outcome of the simulation over these repetitions are displayed in \figref{fig:excitation:FRF1}.
% These results show the averaged estimated FRF ($\hat{G}$), the standard deviation  $\sigma_{\hat{G}}$ on these estimates, the true FRF ($G_0$) and the bias of the estimates ($\Bias (\hat{G})$).

% These graphs show that the bias is more than $20 \unit{dB}$ less than the variance.
% This means that the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated FRFs is mainly caused by the variance $\sigma_{\hat{G}}^2$ and not by a large bias.

% \subsection{Simulations on a range of second order systems}
% The simulation carried out above was repeated for a more general set of systems.
% We studied systems with both a damping of $\damping=0.05$ (as above) and $\damping=0.2$.
% For these different damping values, systems with resonant frequencies
% $\fR \in \{ 40  \unit{Hz}\!,$
%           $ 80  \unit{Hz}\!,$
%           $200  \unit{Hz}\!,$
%           $400  \unit{Hz}\!,$
%           $800  \unit{Hz}\!,$
%           $  2 \unit{kHz}\!,$
%           $  4 \unit{kHz}\!\}$ were considered.
% The parameters pertaining to sampling and the excitation signal were left unchanged
% from the previous simulations. For the systems with a damping of $0.2$, $\sigma_e$
% was put at $0.0678$, which is approximately $10\%$ of the RMS value of $y_0[n]$.
% To allow an easy comparison with a multisine with an equidistant (linear) frequency grid, we also evaluated the variance for such an excitation signal (which had all other parameters determined similarly to the quasi-log multisines).

% In \figref{fig:excitation:damping005} and \figref{fig:excitation:damping02} the results from these
% simulations are presented in a condensed form. 
% They show the mean estimated FRFs ($\hat{G}$), the true FRFs ($G_0$) and the corresponding standard deviations ($\sigma_{\hat{G}}$) near the resonance frequency of the simulated systems.
% The bias was at least $20\unit{dB}$ smaller than the standard deviation as well, but is omitted from the figures for clarity.

% We can verify that for the smaller damping ($\damping=0.05$ in \figref{fig:excitation:damping005})
% the variance near the resonance is almost identical for all systems at $-39.3\unit{dB} \pm 1.8 \unit{dB}$. 

% For the systems that are damped more ($\damping=0.2$ in \figref{fig:excitation:damping02}),
% we observe that the variance is nearly constant over the frequency range as well.
% The standard deviation lies at around $-49.3 \unit{dB} \pm 2.2\unit{dB}$.
% Systems that have a lower resonance frequency, exhibit a slightly higher variance 
% on their estimated FRF (near the resonance). 

% The logarithmically-spaced excitation provides a much more constant dependency of resonance frequency to the variance than a linearly-spaced multisine, where the variance varies over respectively $35$ and $25 \unit{dB}$.

% \subsection{Conclusion}
% The variance on the FRF near resonances with identical damping is nearly independent of the resonance frequency when a quasi-log multisine is used as excitation signal. 
% This result was obtained for second order sections and illustrated on a more general system.
