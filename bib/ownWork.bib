  Abstract                 = {Abstract The identification of the spatially dependent parameters in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is important in both physics and control problems. A methodology is presented to identify spatially dependent parameters from spatio-temporal measurements. Local non-rational transfer functions are derived based on three local measurements allowing for a local estimate of the parameters. A sample Maximum Likelihood Estimator (SMLE) in the frequency domain is used, because it takes noise properties into account and allows for high accuracy consistent parameter estimation. Confidence bounds on the parameters are estimated based on the noise properties of the measurements. This method is successfully applied to the simulations of a finite difference model of a parabolic \{PDE\} with piecewise constant parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Good initial values are crucial to obtain solutions of nonconvex optimization problems. When estimating the transfer function of physical systems from measured noisy data, obtaining good initial parameter estimates is therefore a primordial step. In this paper, it is shown that smoothing the measured frequency response function of a linear time-invariant system enhances the construction of initial estimates significantly, resulting in the optimization schemes to converge to a better optimum. This is achieved with minimal user interaction. Two smoothing techniques, the time-truncated local polynomial method and the regularized finite impulse response, are compared with the existing generalized total least squares and the bootstrapped total least squares initial estimates. The improvement attributable to smoothing is demonstrated by a simulation and by measurements of an electrical filter. The results ultimately show that the parametric models obtained using the proposed starting values are much more likely to give a good description of the measured system and hence lead to more useful models.},

  Abstract                 = {Initial FRF measurements of an unknown system are often a cumbersome endeavor.
How does one design a suitable excitation signal when very little is known about the system?
Excitation signals with a logarithmic power spectral density (PSD) are often used, since these spread the available signal power evenly over the features of the system.
For multisine excitations, such a PSD is to be approximated in the sense that the PSD is discrete and confined to a linear frequency grid.
This results in a quasi-logarithmic (quasi-log) multisine.
In this paper we present an elegant and simple way to design such a quasi-log multisine.
This consists of a well-chosen amplitude spectrum such that it approximates the spectrum of the logarithmic signal closely and suitable choice of the spacing between frequency lines.
Such a signal allows for a robust identification of unknown systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Logarithmically distributed excitation signals are widely used to measure the transfer function of dynamic systems in a wide frequency band, covering several decades. Periodic signals are very popular in advanced dynamic signal analyzers. Generating periodic signals requires an equidistant frequency grid which conflicts with the logarithmic distribution, especially at the low frequencies. In this paper we offer an elegant solution to get around this problem that also makes an improved choice for the amplitude spectrum.},

  Abstract                 = {Optimal input design typically depends on the unknown system parameters that need to be identified. In this paper we consider robust input design for resonant systems that may span over a large frequency band. The concept is to use classical D-optimal design combined with a robust excitation signal which guarantees the same estimate variance regardless of resonance frequency. Simulations show that the proposed signal has the desired properties.},

  Abstract                 = {A statistical impulse response truncation technique is applied to the local polynomial method (LPM)-estimate of the frequency response function (FRF), resulting in an improved, smooth FRF. Formulated as a nonparametric linear-least-squares-estimate, the LPM is first applied to estimate the FRF from a full data record of a single-input-single-output system, systematically expressed in an output-error framework. The smooth characteristics of both the exact FRF and the leakage from transients allow for an optimal application of the local polynomial method, leading to the elimination of both the leakage and interpolation errors. The truncation method introduced in this paper makes it possible for the user to fine-tune the tradeoff between the uncertainty (variance) and the bias on the estimated instantaneous FRF.},

Difierent large data sets are provided, enabling the use of both frequency domain and time domain identification approaches. The idea of the benchmark is to investigate both model accuracy and numerical reliability of the computational steps. Several reference solutions are provided, which demonstrate the challenging aspects of this benchmark already in the singleinput single-output case.
