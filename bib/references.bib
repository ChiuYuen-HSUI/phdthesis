  Abstract                 = {Model order selection is an important element in system identification. It is well known that common model order selection methods such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian's information criterion (BIC) neglect relevant information that is available in models of order different from the one chosen. In this paper the model order selection problem for receivers similar to those found in GSM and EDGE systems is reviewed briefly and is solved with a multi-model approach based on simultaneous consideration of several models. Two methods are evaluated; a multi-model noise suppression filter and multi-model soft combining. The algorithms are implemented and evaluated by means of simulations. The performance of each method is analyzed for GSM and EDGE receivers in a link level simulator. Simulation results show a significant improvement in performance at the cost of increased computational complexity for the multi-model approach.

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  Abstract                 = {In this thesis, a 4th order rotational mechanical plant provided by Educational Control Products is modeled from first principles and represented in state-space form. Identification of the state-space parameters was accomplished using the parameter estimation function in Matlab{\textquoteright}s System Identification Toolbox utilizing experimental input/output data. The identified model was then constructed in Simulink and the accuracy of the identified model parameters was studied. The open loop stability of the plant, as well as its controllability and observability were analyzed to determine the applicability of a pole placement control strategy. Based on the results of this analysis, a full state variable feedback controller was investigated to place the system{\textquoteright}s poles such that a rotational disk would perfectly track a step angle input with less than five percent overshoot and have less than a one second settling time, with no steady-state error. A refinement of this controller, to include an observer to estimate the system states, was also investigated. Finally, the results of this work are summarized and presented as a series of laboratories applicable to a course in state-space design.},

A particular attention is paid to leakage errors, for which this procedure has been frequently criticised. Exact and asymptotic expressions for the bias and variance are provided, whose minimisation enables the derivation of the optimal settings to be used with this procedure. Our main finding is that a Half-sine or Diff window with 2 3 overlap achieves the best compromise to reduce leakage errors, and this is independently of the system frequency response function. This conclusion is to be contrasted with the customary habit of using a Hanning window with 1 2 overlap.},

  Abstract                 = {In this chapter alternatives to state-space descriptions were introduced and used to further study the behavior of linear time-invariant systems and to study in depth structural properties of feedback control systems. In Part 1, the properties of systems described by Polynomial Matrix Descriptions (PMDs) were explored in Section 7.3 and background on polynomial matrices was provided in Section 7.2. The Diophantine Equation, which plays an important role in feedback systems, was studied at length in Subsection 7.2E. An in-depth study of the theory of parameterizations of all stabilizing controllers with emphasis on PMDs was undertaken in Part 2, Subsection 7.4A, and the parameterizations of all proper stabilizing controllers in terms of proper and stable Matrix Fraction Descriptions (MFDs) were derived in Subsection 7.4C. State feedback and state estimation using PMDs were studied in Subsection 7.4B. Finally, control systems with two degrees of freedom controllers were explored in Subsection 7. 4D, with an emphasis on stability, parameterizations of all stabilizing controllers, and attainable response maps.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the ``fractional Fourier transform,'' which admits computation by an algorithm that has complexity proportional to the fast Fourier transform algorithm. Whereas the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is based on integral roots of unity $e^{- 2 \pi i/n}$, the fractional Fourier transform is based on fractional roots of unity $e^{-2 \pi i \alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is arbitrary. The fractional Fourier transform and the corresponding fast algorithm are useful for such applications as computing DFTs of sequences with prime lengths, computing DFTs of sparse sequences, analyzing sequences with noninteger periodicities, performing high-resolution trigonometric interpolation, detecting lines in noisy images, and detecting signals with linearly drifting frequencies. In many cases, the resulting algorithms are faster by arbitrarily large factors than conventional techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper revisits the problem of decentralised control of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. In industrial process control this problem is typically solved through the use of Proportional Integral and Derivative (PID) regulators that are used to close single loops, according to the implicit assumption that interactions between input and output variables can be neglected. However special care and conservatism are required for the choice of the regulator gains so that stability can be preserved also in the presence of the interactions. The decentralised MIMO control problem is solved here by extending the Variable Structure - Proportional Controller (VS-PI) proposed in to the MIMO case, and considering a priority-based approach for the sequential control of the single loops. In this paper the general idea is presented and preliminary simulation results including a robot control using brushless DC motor drives are included.},

These include estimates of coherent output spectra and estimates of gain and phase factors of related frequency response functions. Models are either single input/output models or conditioned input/output models, where the latter models can be created from arbitrary measured multiple input/output data. Guidelines are presented to reduce statistical errors in such computed quantities. These results are essential for applications to identify different multiple noise sources, to determine multiple system properties, to measure response effects due to the sources acting singly or in various combinations, to simulate multiple random environments, and to predict system failures from response measurements only.},

In typical norm-based control designs, these performance and robustness requirements are specified in a scalar optimization criterion, even for complex multivariable systems. This paper aims to develop a novel and systematic approach for the formulation of this optimization criterion for complex multivariable systems. Hereto, characteristics of the underlying system are exploited. In contrast to pre-existing approaches that typically lead to multiloop SISO weighting functions, the proposed approach enables the design of multivariable weighting functions. Experimental results confirm that the proposed procedure significantly improves the performance of an industrial motion system compared to earlier approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {This contribution derives new large-sample properties of the result of Maximum-Likelihood identification of a discrete-time process, characterized by an unknown, rational input-transfer function G and an unknown, rational noise-transfer function F. The purpose is to develop some means to detect possible false results of such an identification, caused by unknowingly violating prerequisites for the identification, e.g. by incorrect model structure or order, or having reached a local maximum in the search. Also, the effect of linear feedback and the identifiability in closed loop are discussed. Results are applied to artificially generated data and to plant data—collected in closed loop from the drying process in paper making. Cet article deduit des proprietés nouvelles à echantillons multiples, du résultat de l'identification à l'aide de la plus grande vraisemblance d'un processus à temps discret, caractérisé par une fonction de transfert rationelle inconnue G du signal d'entrée et une fonction de transfert rationelle inconnue F du bruit. Le but consiste à trouver un moyen de détecter des résultats erronnés possibles d'une telle identification provoqués par une violation inconsciente des préalables de l'identification, par exemple à la suite d'une structure ou d'un ordre inexacts du modèle ou d'un maximum local atteint pendant l'exploration. L'article discute également les effets de la réaction linéaire et de la capacité à l'identification en boucle fermée. Les résultats sont appliqués à des données artificiellement crées et à des données experimentales relevées en boucle fermée dans un processus de sèchage en papeterie. Dieser Beitrag leitet neue Eigenschaften des Ergebnisses der Maximum Likelihood Identifikation eines diskontinuierlichen Prozesses ab, der durch eine unbekannte, rationale Eingangs-Ausgangs-Funktion G und eine unbekannte rationale Rauschübertragungsfunktion F charaketrisiert wird. Zu entwickeln sind einige Wege, um mögliche falsche Resultate solch einer Identifikation z.B. durch nicht korrekte Modellstruktur oder -anordnung oder die Erreichung eines lokalen Maximums bei der Suche zu entdecken. Ferner wird die Wirkung einer linearen Rückkopplung und die Identifizierbarkeit in geschlossener Schleife diskutiert. Resultate werden auf künstlich erzeugte Daten und auf Anlagendaten angewandt, die im geschlossenen Kreise beim Trocknungsprozeβ der Papierherstellung gesammelt wurden.

  Abstract                 = {The characterization of biological materials and systems using electrical impedance spectroscopy has traditionally been performed using the frequency sweep technique. When applied to in-vivo measurements, the movement induced modulation has often a period shorter than the sweep time. This drawback can be overcome using broadband signal bursts. Given that the energy amount to be injected to the biological material is limited for safety reasons, the best choice is the use of multisine signals, which concentrate all that energy in the measurement frequencies, then achieving an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. The uniform distribution of frequencies is not adequate due to the system nonlinearities and to the need of covering a three-decade frequency range. This work is concerned with the design of a quasilogarithmic multisine with a similar number of frequencies at each decade and with a safety band around each measurement frequency. This band will be free of harmonics and quadratic intermodulation products. The system has been implemented using a virtual instrument based on an arbitrary waveform generator, a digital oscilloscope and an analog frontend. The system has been validated using passive RC networks and has been applied to the in-vivo characterization of infarcted myocardium in pigs},

The mean-adjusted estimator is also considered, and saddlepoint approximations are used to lower the computational burden of all the estimators. Large-scale simulation studies for assessing their small-sample properties are conducted. Their relative performance depends almost exclusively on the value of the autoregressive parameter, with the new estimator dominating over a large part of the parameter space.},

The accuracy of three transfer function estimators is compared, showing an infinite variance for the Experimental Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE) and a better efficiency for the estimators which are based on the cross spectrum. The variance due to additive noise depends on whether the input is a stochastic or a deterministic signal.},

An equivalence of a single-sample cross-validation index and the Akaike information criterion is pointed out. It is seen that the optimal number of parameters suggested by both single-sample and two-sample cross-validation indices will depend on sample size. },

By monitoring the performance via a model-based approach, the possibility to guarantee performance improvement in the iterative scheme is being employed. In order to monitor achieved performance (for a present controller) and to guar- antee robust performance (for a future controller), an uncertainty set is used where the uncertainty structure is chosen in terms of model perturbations in the dual Youla parametrization. This uncertainty structure is shown to be particularly suitable for the control performance measure that is considered. The model uncertainty set can be identified by an uncertainty estimation proce- dure on the basis of closed-loop experimental data. To obtain performance robust- ness, robust control design tools are used to synthesise controllers on the basis of the identified uncertainty set.},

Although \{AIC\} and \{AICc\} share the same objective, the derivations of the criteria proceed along very different lines, making it difficult to reconcile how \{AICc\} improves upon the approximations leading to AIC. To address this issue, we present a derivation which unifies the justifications of \{AIC\} and \{AICc\} in the linear regression framework.},

The role of time delay is also studied in this context. Most notably, we show that the performance and design limitations in multivariable systems intrinsically depend on the locations as well as directions of unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros, and in particular, on how pole and zero directions are aligned. The latter is characterized by angles measuring the mutual orientation between zero and pole directions, and it is shown to play a crucial role in multivariable system design},

One key of this approach is to solve the hyper-parameter estimation problem that is usually nonconvex. Our goal here is to investigate implementation of algorithms for solving the hyper-parameter estimation problem that can deal with both large data sets and possibly ill-conditioned computations. In particular, a \{QR\} factorization based matrix-inversion-free algorithm is proposed to evaluate the cost function in an efficient and accurate way. It is also shown that the gradient and Hessian of the cost function can be computed based on the same \{QR\} factorization. Finally, the proposed algorithm and ideas are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations on a large data-bank of test systems and data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Intrigued by some recent results on impulse response estimation by kernel and nonparametric techniques, we revisit the old problem of transfer function estimation from input--output measurements. We formulate a classical regularization approach, focused on finite impulse response (FIR) models, and find that regularization is necessary to cope with the high variance problem. This basic, regularized least squares approach is then a focal point for interpreting other techniques, like Bayesian inference and Gaussian process regression. The main issue is how to determine a suitable regularization matrix (Bayesian prior or kernel). Several regularization matrices are provided and numerically evaluated on a data bank of test systems and data sets. Our findings based on the data bank are as follows. The classical regularization approach with carefully chosen regularization matrices shows slightly better accuracy and clearly better robustness in estimating the impulse response than the standard approach--the prediction error method/maximum likelihood (PEM/ML) approach. If the goal is to estimate a model of given order as well as possible, a low order model is often better estimated by the PEM/ML approach, and a higher order model is often better estimated by model reduction on a high order regularized \{FIR\} model estimated with careful regularization. Moreover, an optimal regularization matrix that minimizes the mean square error matrix is derived and studied. The importance of this result lies in that it gives the theoretical upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved for this classical regularization approach.},

The author's emphasis is on providing a unified treatment of linear models, including analysis of variance models and regression models, based on projections, orthogonality, and other vector space ideas. Every chapter comes with numerous exercises and examples that make it ideal for a graduate-level course. All of the standard topics are covered in depth: ANOVA, estimation including Bayesian estimation, hypothesis testing, multiple comparisons, regression analysis, and experimental design models. In addition, the book covers topics that are not usually treated at this level, but which are important in their own right: balanced incomplete block designs, testing for lack of fit, testing for independence, models with singular covariance matrices, variance component estimation, best linear and best linear unbiased prediction, collinearity, and variable selection. This new edition includes a more extensive discussion of best prediction and associated ideas of R2, as well as new sections on inner products and perpendicular projections for more general spaces and Milliken and Graybill{\textquoteright}s generalization of Tukey{\textquoteright}s one degree of freedom for nonadditivity test.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we introduce several novel tools for the reduction of errors in parameters estimated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments. An optimization strategy is developed that minimizes an estimate of the errors on the parameters while bounding the experimental time. The approach is also used to reduce experimental time while keeping a bound on the parameter errors. This feature is particularly critical in systems changing significantly within the experimental time. The paper uses a fuel cell electrode model to test this methodology and presents a real time algorithm for coupling experiment with the parameter estimation and experimental optimization. },

Proper selection of the kernel bandwidth is, however, a critical step for superior space analysis and partitioning. This paper presents a mean shift-based approach for local bandwidth selection in the multimodal, multivariate case. The method is based on a fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. This paper demonstrates that, within the large sample approximation, the local covariance is estimated by the matrix that maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Using this property, the paper develops a reliable algorithm which takes into account the stability of local bandwidth estimates across scales. The validity of the theoretical results is proven in various space partitioning experiments involving the variable-bandwidth mean shift.},

By applying a procedure similar to Bartlett's procedure of periodogram averaging to the FIR estimate, in conjunction with a periodic input signal, the statistics of the modelling error asymptotically can be obtained from the data. The modelling error consists of two parts: an averaging (probabilistic) part, due to the stochastic noise disturbance on the data, and a worst case (deterministic) part, due to the unmodelled dynamics. The latter is explicitly bounded with a hard error bound, while for the former a confidence interval can be specified asymptotically. The resulting error bounds appear to be highly realistic and, as a consequence, suitable for high performance robust control design purposes},

In this paper a procedure is presented to quantify the model uncertainty of any prespecified nominal model, from a sequence of measurement data of input and output signals from a plant. By employing a non-parametric empirical transfer function estimate (ETFE), we are able to split the model uncertainty into three parts: the inherent uncertainty in the data due to data-imperfections, the unmodelled dynamics in the nominal model, and the uncertainty due to interpolation. A frequency-dependent hard error bound is constructed, and results are given for tightening the bound through input design. When the upper bound on the model uncertainty is too conservative, in view of the control design specifications, information is provided as to which additional experiments have to be performed in order to improve the bound.},

  Abstract                 = {Various techniques of system identification exist that provide a nominal model and an uncertainty bound. An important question is what the implications are for the particular choice of the structure in which the uncertainty is described when dealing with robust stability/performance analysis of a given controller and when dealing with robust synthesis. It is shown that an amplitude-bounded (circular) uncertainty set can equivalently be described in terms of an additive, Youla parameter and ν -gap uncertainty. As a result, the choice of structure does not matter provided that the identification methods deliver optimal uncertainty sets rather than an uncertainty bound around a prefixed nominal model. Frequency-dependent closed-loop performance functions based on the uncertainty sets are again bounded by circles in the frequency domain, allowing for analytical expressions for worst-case performance and for the evaluation of the consequences of uncertainty for robust design. The results can be used to tune optimal experimental conditions in view of robust control design and in the further development of experiment-based robust control design methods. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Prediction Error Method (PEM) is related to an optimization problem built on input/output data collected from the system to be identified. It is often hard to find the global solution of this optimization problem because the corresponding objective function presents local minima and/or the search space is constrained to a nonconvex set. The shape of the cost function, and hence the difficulty in solving the optimization problem, depends directly on the experimental conditions, more specifically on the spectrum of the input/output data collected from the system. Therefore, it seems plausible to improve the convergence to the global minimum by properly choosing the spectrum of the input; in this paper, we address this problem. We present a condition for convergence to the global minimum of the cost function and propose its inclusion in the input design. We present the application of the proposed approach to case studies where the algorithms tend to get trapped in nonglobal minima. },

  Abstract                 = {A training set of data has been used to construct a rule for predicting future responses. What is the error rate of this rule? This is an important question both for comparing models and for assessing a final selected model. The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased but can be highly variable. Here we discuss bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. We show that a particular bootstrap method, the .632+ rule, substantially outperforms cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric and apply to any possible prediction rule; however, we study only classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include "smooth" prediction rules like Fisher's linear discriminant function and unsmooth ones like nearest neighbors.},

  Abstract                 = {Usual modal analysis techniques are based on the Fourier transform. Due to the $\Delta T \Delta f$ limitation, they perform poorly when the modal overlap $\mu$ exceeds 30 \% . A technique based on a high-resolution analysis algorithm and an order-detection method is presented here, with the aim of filling the gap between the low- and the high-frequency domains. A pseudo-impulse force is applied at points of interests of a structure and the response is measured at a given point. For each pair of measurements, the impulse response of the structure is retrieved by deconvolving the pseudo-impulse force and filtering the response with the result. Following conditioning treatments, the reconstructed impulse response is analysed in different frequency-bands. In each frequency-band, the number of modes is evaluated, the frequencies and damping factors are estimated, and the complex amplitudes are finally extracted. As examples of application, the separation of the twin modes of a square plate and the partial modal analyses of aluminium plates up to a modal overlap of 70 \% are presented. Results measured with this new method and those calculated with an improved Rayleigh method match closely.},

  Abstract                 = {When estimating a mean regression function and its derivatives, locally weighted least squares regression has proven to be a very attractive technique. The present paper focuses on the important issue of how to select the smoothing parameter or bandwidth. In the case of estimating curves with a complicated structure, a variable bandwidth is desirable. Furthermore, the bandwidth should be indicated by the data themselves. Recent developments in nonparametric smoothing techniques inspired us to propose such a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure, which can be used to select both constant and variable bandwidths. The idea is based on a residual squares criterion along with a good approximation of the bias and variance of the estimator. The procedure can be applied to select bandwidths not only for estimating the regression curve but also for estimating its derivatives. The resulting estimation procedure has the necessary flexibility for capturing complicated shapes of curves. This is illustrated via a large variety of testing examples, including examples with a large spatial variability. The results are also compared with wavelet thresholding techniques, and it seems that our results are at least comparable, i.e. local polynomial regression using our data-driven variable bandwidth has spatial adaptation properties that are similar to wavelets.},

The present paper addresses this question when using local polynomial approximations for estimating the regression function and its derivatives. A fully-automatic bandwidth selection procedure has been proposed by Fan and Gijbels (1995a), and the empirical performance of it was tested in detail via a variety of examples. Those experiences supported the methodology towards a great extend. In this paper we establish asymptotic results for the proposed variable bandwidth selector. We provide the rate of convergence of the bandwidth estimate, and obtain the asymptotic distribution of its error relative to the theoretical optimal variable bandwidth. These asymptotic properties give extra support to the proposed bandwidth selection procedure. It is also demonstrated how the proposed selection method can be applied in the density estimation setup. Some examples illustrate this application.},

The close interconnection between these two disciplines is explored in some detail. This approach makes it possible to apply recursive parameter estimation algorithms to adaptive signal processing. Several examples are discussed including: adaptive line enhancement, generalized adaptive noise cancelling, adaptive deconvolution and adaptive TDOA estimation. It is shown how the recursive maximum likelihood algorithm can be used for both FIR and IIR filtering, and some preliminary results are presented. Several alternative algorithms are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper the problem of selecting an optimal input for identifying an unknown parameter of a known discrete system by observing its output in the presence of Gaussian noise is considered. The system is assumed to be a generalized discrete system in which the inputs and possible parameter values are members of a finite set. The criterion for the optimal input is defined as that which maximizes the probability of correctly determining the true parameter value from a multiple hypothesis test. Although the above criterion totally orders the set of inputs, it is a difficult task to select the best inputs. Some theorems are presented which yield a partial ordering whose extension is the desired total ordering. In the special case of strong noise, it is shown that the ordering of inputs can be related to the perimeter in the output vector space. The results of the paper are applicable to the selection of preset input lengths or to adaptive identification.},

It delivers a parametric uncertainty ellipsoid and a corresponding set of parameterized transfer functions, which we call prediction error (PE) uncertainty set. Such uncertainty set differs from the classical uncertainty descriptions used in robust control analysis and design. We develop a robust control analysis theory for such uncertainty sets, which covers two distinct aspects: (1) Controller validation. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for a specific controller to stabilize or to achieve a given level of performance with all systems in such PE uncertainty set. (2) Model validation for robust control. We present a measure for the size of such PE uncertainty set that is directly connected to the size of a set controllers that stabilize all systems in the model uncertainty set. This allows us to establish that one uncertainty set is better tuned for robust control design than another, leading to control-oriented validation objectives.},

  Abstract                 = {Total Least Squares (TLS) is a method of fitting that is appropriate when there are errors in both the observation vector b (m $\times$ 1) and in the data matrix A (m $\times$ n). The technique has been discussed by several authors, and amounts to fitting a "best" subspace to the points (aT i,bi), i = 1, $\cdots$, m, where aT i is the ith row of A. In this paper a singular value decomposition analysis of the TLS problem is presented. The sensitivity of the TLS problem as well as its relationship to ordinary least squares regression is explored. An algorithm for solving the TLS problem is proposed that utilizes the singular value decomposition and which provides a measure of the underlying problem's sensitivity.},

However, when the input signal is random, or it can only be observed with an observation error, the quality of the ETFE deteriorates, Its variance can be infinite even for large signal-to-noise ratios. This is not well known. This paper establishes and analyzes a mathematical model of the ETFE with noisy input signals. It explains the cause of the large variance and suggests modifications which eliminate the above problems.},

If available, the variance at each spectral line of the logarithmic frequency response data can be used to weight the logarithmic least-squares estimator, resulting in parameter estimates with a smaller variability. An estimate of these variances can be derived from the residual errors at the excited spectral lines. Besides its robustness to lack of prior noise information, it is demonstrated that the logarithmic estimator behaves remarkably well in the presence of outliers},

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally, the frequency response function has been estimated directly by dividing the discrete Fourier transforms of the output and the input of the system. This approach suffers from leakage errors and noise sensitivity. Lately these errors have been studied in detail. The main observation is that the error has a smooth frequency characteristic that is highly structured. The recently proposed local polynomial method uses this smoothness, and tries to estimate the frequency response function along with a smooth approximation of the error term. In this paper we propose a method, closely related to the local polynomial method, but instead of using the smoothness of the error we explore the structure even further. The proposed approach to estimate the frequency response function seems promising, as illustrated by simulations and comparison with current state of the art methods.},

The aim of this paper is to develop a new algorithm for parametric system identification with favorable convergence properties and optimal numerical conditioning. Recent results in frequency-domain instrumental variable identification are exploited, which lead to enhanced convergence properties compared to classical identification algorithms. In addition, bi-orthonormal polynomials with respect to a data-dependent bi-linear form are introduced for system identification. Hereby, optimal numerical conditioning of the relevant system of equations is achieved. This is shown to be particularly important for the class of instrumental variable algorithms, for which numerical conditioning is typically quadratic compared to alternative frequency-domain identification algorithms. Superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by means of both simulation and experimental results. },

The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of the experimental controller in robust-control-relevant modeling. Such a study is sensible only when unnecessary conservatism is prevented in the construction of perturbed model sets. Hereto, this paper establishes a model uncertainty description that transparently connects to the imposed robust performance criterion. By confronting the developed approach with a next-generation industrial wafer stage, the important role of the experimental controller during modeling for robust control is clarified indeed. It turns out that only after an increase of performance in successive control design iterations, construction of higher order model sets becomes both feasible and significant. As such, in pursuit of performance optimization up to fundamental limits, the experimental controller ensures a gradual extrapolation of the current experimental conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Starting from a number of motivating and abundant applications in $\S2$ , including control of robots, eigenvalue computations, mechanical stress of materials, and statistical design, the authors describe a class of optimization problems which are referred to as semi-infinite, because their constraints bound functions of a finite number of variables on a whole region. In $\S\S3-5$ , first- and second-order optimality conditions are derived for general nonlinear problems as well as a procedure for reducing the problem locally to one with only finitely many constraints. Another main effort for achieving simplification is through duality in $\S6$ . There, algebraic properties of finite linear programming are brought to bear on duality theory in semi-infinite programming. Section 7 treats numerical methods based on either discretization or local reduction with the emphasis on the design of superlinearly convergent (SQP-type) methods. Taking this differentiable point of view, this paper can be considered to be complementary to the review given by Polak [SIAM Rev., 29 (1987), 21-89] on the nondifferentiable approach. The last, short section briefly reviews some work done on parametric problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We have examined an optimization approach to iterative control design. The important ingredient is that the gradient of the design criterion is computed from measured closed loop data. The approach is thus not model-based. The scheme converges to a stationary point of the design criterion under the assumption of boundedness of the signals in the loop. From a practical viewpoint, the scheme offers several advantages. It is straightforward to apply. It is possible to control the rate of change of the controller in each iteration. The objective can be manipulated between iterations in order to tighten or loosen performance requirements. Certain frequency regions can be emphasized if desired. This direct optimal tuning algorithm is particularly well suited for the tuning of the basic control loops in the process industry, which are typically PID loops. These primary loops are often very badly tuned, making the application of more advanced (for example, multivariable) techniques rather useless.

The correction is of particular use when the sample size is small, or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size. The corrected method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient if the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore, when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method. Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive moving average time series models are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) is a very useful model selection tool, but it is not as well understood as it should be. I frequently read papers, or hear talks, which demonstrate misunderstandings or misuse of this important tool. The following points should clarify some aspects of the AIC, and hopefully reduce its misuse.

1. The AIC is a penalized likelihood, and so it requires the likelihood to be maximized before it can be calculated. It makes little sense to compute the AIC if estimation is done using something else (e.g., minimizing MAPE). Normally, the residuals are assumed to be Gaussian, and then ML estimates are often (but not always) equivalent to LS estimates. In these cases, computing the AIC after minimizing the MSE is ok.
2. A model selected by the AIC after Gaussian MLE will give predictions equal to the conditional mean. If you then compare the predictions using MAE, or MAPE, or some other criterion, they may not perform well because these other criteria are not optimal for the conditional mean. Match the error measure to the estimation method.
3. The AIC does not assume the residuals are Gaussian. It is just that the Gaussian likelihood is most frequently used. But if you want to use some other distribution, go ahead. The AIC is the penalized likelihood, whichever likelihood you choose to use.
4. The AIC does not require nested models. One of the neat things about the AIC is that you can compare very different models. However, make sure the likelihoods are computed on the same data. For example, you cannot compare an ARIMA model with differencing to an ARIMA model without differencing, because you lose one or more observations via differencing. That is why auto.arima uses a unit root test to choose the order of differencing, and only uses the AIC to select the orders of the AR and MA components.
5. For a similar reason, you cannot compare the AIC from an ETS model with the AIC from an ARIMA model. The two models treat initial values differently. For example, after differencing, an ARIMA model is computed on fewer observations, whereas an ETS model is always computed on the full set of data. Even when the models are equivalent (e.g., an ARIMA(0,1,1) and an ETS(A,N,N)), the AIC values will be different. Effectively, the likelihood of an ETS model is conditional on the initial state vector, whereas the likelihood of a non-stationary ARIMA model is conditional on the first few observations, even when a diffuse prior is used for the nonstationary components.
6. Beware of AIC values computed using conditional likelihoods because the conditioning may be different for different models. Then the AIC values are not comparable.
7. Frequently, the constant term in the AIC is omitted. That is fine for model selection as the constant is the same for all models. But be careful comparing the AIC value between software packages, or between model classes, as they may treat the constant term differently, and then the AIC values are not comparable.
8. The AIC is not really an “in-sample” measure. Yes, it is computed using the training data. But asymptotically, minimizing the AIC is equivalent to minimizing the leave-one-out cross-validation MSE for cross-sectional data, and equivalent to minimizing the out-of-sample one-step forecast MSE for time series models. This property is what makes it such an attractive criterion for use in selecting models for forecasting.
9. The AIC is not a measure of forecast accuracy. Although it has the above cross-validation property, comparing AIC values across data sets is essentially meaningless. If you really want to measure the cross-validated MSE, then you will need to calculate it directly.
10. The AIC is not a consistent model selection method. That does not bother me as I don’t believe there is a true model to be selected. The AIC is optimal (in some senses) for forecasting, and that is much more important in my opinion.

There are some further helpful clarifications in AIC Myths and Misunderstandings by Anderson and Burnham.},

This equivalence allows: (1) easy calculation of the likelihood, the AIC and other model selection criteria; (2) computation of prediction intervals for each method; and (3) random simulation from the underlying state space model. We demonstrate the methods by applying them to the data from the M-competition and the M3-competition. The method provides forecast accuracy comparable to the best methods in the competitions; it is particularly good for short forecast horizons with seasonal data.},

Let Sn,v[a,b] be the set of piecewise rational functions which have pieces of degree n and no more than v breakpoints. The paper deals with the construction of fn,v $\in$ Sn,y[a,b] close to a given f $\in$ Hvp[a,b], to estimate the order of the least Lp(w) distance from f to Sn,v[a,b]. It is concluded that the piecewise rational approximation is better for Hvp[a,b] than the rational one. This theory extends results of Gonchar (1967) on the rational approximation to f $\in$ H0$\infty$[$-$1,1], and can be applied to study the asymptotic behavior of piecewise rational methods to solve a singular identification problem associated with the equation w(2) + (f + $\lambda$)w = 0, in terms of the error equation criterion. },

An analysis of the residuals of the latter estimation reveals the frequency band in which the contributions from the time variation dominates the disturbing measurement noise and, thus, is significant. All concepts are illustrated on a simulation and real measurement examples.},

Such signals are meaningful for data-centric estimation and control methods, where uniform coverage of the output state-space contributes greatly to good performance. The optimization problem includes a search for both the Fourier coefficients and phases in the multisine signal, resulting in a uniformly distributed output signal that achieves a desirable balance between high and low gain directions, an important consideration when identifying strongly interactive multivariable systems. The solution involves very little user intervention and has significant benefits compared to multisine signals that minimize crest factor. The usefulness of this problem formulation is shown by applying it to a case study involving composition control of a binary distillation column.},

The output is corrupted by nonstationary, nonwhite additive observation noise, and the observation time is finite. The reproducing kernel Hilbert space formulation is used to obtain the parameter estimates and the error covariance matrix in terms of the input. The performance index, assumed to be a function of the error covariance matrix, is minimized by a variational procedure. A necessary condition for optimality is that the input satisfy a nonlinear Fredholm equation. An example estimates the gain of a single time constant system where the observation noise has an exponential autocorrelation function. For broadband noise, the optimum input is a portion of a sinusoid. For a noise bandwidth narrower than the system bandwidth, the optimum input switches sign as rapidly as possible, but near-optimum performance can be obtained with a relatively high frequency sinusoidal input.},

The form in which this expression is usually desired is that of a ratio of two frequency-dependent polynomials. In this paper, a method of evaluation of the polynomial coefficients is presented. It is based on the minimization of the weighted sum of the squares of the errors between the absolute magnitudes of the actual function and the polynomial ratio, taken at various values of frequency (the independent variable). The problem of the evaluation of the unknown coefficients is reduced to that of the numerical solution of certain determinants. The elements of these determinants are functions of the amplitude ratio and phase shift, taken at various values of frequency. This form of solution is particularly adaptable to digital computing methods, be-because of the simplicity in the required programming. The treatment is restricted to systems which have no poles on the imaginary axis; i.e., to systems having a finite, steady-state (zero frequency) magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {Front-end electronics (FEEs) with a trigger function typically involve a diverged interconnect, which transfers signals from an amplifier block to both a magnitude acquisition block and a timing acquisition block. The FEE suffers from inherent reflection due to the impedance mismatch at the diverged interconnect, particularly in high-speed applications. In this paper, the effects of the diverged interconnect in the FEE are analyzed in the frequency domain. A transfer function of the FEE is derived, and the frequency responses are estimated under diverse characteristic impedance and termination conditions of the diverged interconnect. The estimated results are confirmed by performing experiments with test circuits. It can be observed that the frequency range where the frequency response is distorted becomes lower with the increase in the width of the diverged interconnect and its termination capacitance, which corresponded to the input capacitance of the trigger circuit.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Time-periodic (TP) phenomena occurring, for instance, in wind turbines, helicopters, anisotropic shaft-bearing systems, and cardiovascular/respiratory systems, are often not addressed when classical frequency response function (FRF) measurements are performed. As the traditional \{FRF\} concept is based on the linear time-invariant (LTI) system theory, it is only approximately valid for systems with varying dynamics. Accordingly, the quantification of any deviation from this ideal \{LTI\} framework is more than welcome. The “measure of deviation” allows us to define the notion of the best \{LTI\} (BLTI) approximation, which yields the best – in mean square sense – \{LTI\} description of a linear time-periodic \{LTP\} system. By taking into consideration the \{TP\} effects, it is shown in this paper that the variability of the \{BLTI\} measurement can be reduced significantly compared with that of classical \{FRF\} estimators. From a single experiment, the proposed identification methods can handle (non-)linear time-periodic [(N)LTP] systems in open-loop with a quantification of (i) the noise and/or the \{NL\} distortions, (ii) the \{TP\} distortions and (iii) the transient (leakage) errors. Besides, a geometrical interpretation of the \{BLTI\} approximation is provided, leading to a framework called vector \{FRF\} analysis. The theory presented is supported by numerical simulations as well as real measurements mimicking the well-known mechanical Mathieu oscillator.},

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the possibilities for the application of a fully data-based uncertainty modeling procedure for high performance robust control. By virtue of a dual-Youla framework, a connection is found that directly relates the size of the uncertainty model to the performance criterium. A novel data-based algorithm is introduced in this work, that iterates on the physical system, without the need of an uncertainty model, to obtain a description for the maximum size of the uncertainty. These results enable the design of a high performance robust controller and provide new insight in experiment design for frequency response based uncertainty estimations.},

  Abstract                 = {A review of the relationship between the frequency response function of linear system and the DFT of the input and output signals show that the output DFT is a sum of two terms. The first term contain the FRF multiplied with the input DFT and the second term capture the effect when the system is not operating in a periodic fashion. The utilization of these two terms when performing non-parametric frequency response function estimation has led to the previously developed Local Polynomial Method. This paper acknowledge that the two terms can better be approximated by local rational functions with a common denominator polynomial and a new method called Local Rational Method has been developed. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the new rational method in comparison with the polynomial one. The results suggest that the new rational method gives better performance when the system has a resonant behavior.},

The progression has been toward more general models, more realistic criteria, better understanding of the nature of the optimal inputs, and the development of more efficient computational methods. All of these developments have led to a stage at which applications to a number of practical problems are within the state of the art. The first systematic attempt at obtaining an optimal input seems to have been that of Levin (1960), who considers estimation of the impulse response function of a discrete-time single-input single-output (SISO) linear system in the presence of white measurement noise. Levin shows that the optimal energy or amplitude-constrained input that minimizes the trace or the determinant of the covariance matrix is a white noise sequence.},

The criterion used for optimization is the sensitivity of the system output to the unknown parameters as expressed by the weighted trace of the Fisher information matrix. It is shown that the optimal energy constrained input is an eigenfunction of a positive self-adjoint operator corresponding to its largest eigenvalue. Several different representations of the optimal input and several methods for its numerical computation are considered. The results are extended to systems with process noise, and the relationship to other criteria for input design are brought out. Three analytical examples are solved in closed form which show that the optimal input is a sum of sine and cosine functions at appropriate frequencies. Optimal elevator deflections for identifying the short period parameters of C-8 aircraft are computed numerically and compared with the doublet input currently in use.},

In plant-friendly identification, the designer has to respect constraints on experiment time, input and output amplitudes or input move sizes. This work focuses on plant friendly input design with constraints on input move size and output power. We present a convex relaxation to the problem of designing an informative input subject to input move size and output power constraints. The problem is finitely parametrized using ideas from Tchebycheff systems and reformulated as a SemiDefinite Programme. },

Seven methods for the single proportion are evaluated on 96,000 parameter space points. Intervals based on tail areas and the simpler score methods are recommended for use.

  Abstract                 = {For many applications, resonating sensors can be designed which exhibit excellent sensitivity of the resonant parameters (resonant frequency and quality factor) to the wanted physical parameters. When the resonant parameters are to be derived from measured data, the utilized signal processing algorithm significantly affects the precision of the obtained results, in particular, when the resonance is impaired with spurious contributions. In particular, for systems with low Q -factors (e.g., electromechanical resonators in viscous liquids with Q < 100), the measurement precision suffers from various unwanted spectral components induced by parasitic effects of the resonator and measurement errors. In order to separate the adverse effects from the ideal second-order characteristics, three related methods for estimating the parameters of second-order resonant systems are introduced in this paper extending established methods. To this end, the spectrum is separated into a component induced by a second- order resonant system and an unknown background spectrum.},

We study the properties of the degree of circularity based on second-order moments, called circularity quotient, that is shown to possess an intuitive geometrical interpretation: the modulus and phase of its principal square-root are equal to the eccentricity and angle of orientation of the ellipse deﬁned by the covariance matrix of the real and imaginary part of $z$. Hence, when the eccentricity approaches the minimum zero (ellipse is a circle), the circularity quotient vanishes; when the eccentricity approaches the maximum one, the circularity quotient lies on the unit complex circle. Connection with the correlation coefﬁcient is established and bounds on given the circularity quotient (and vice versa) are derived. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) of circularity assuming complex normal sample is shown to be a function of the modulus of the circularity quotient with asymptotic $\xi^2_2$ distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation precision motion systems are lightweight to meet stringent requirements regarding throughput and accuracy. Such lightweight systems typically exhibit lightly damped flexible dynamics in the controller cross-over region. State-of-the-art modeling and motion control design procedures do not deliver the required model fidelity to control the flexible dynamical behavior. In this paper, identification and control challenges are investigated and a novel approach for next-generation motion control is presented. The procedure is applied to a multivariable wafer stage, confirming a significant performance improvement.},

It is seen that the plug-in bandwidth is usually most efficient when the underlying density is sufficiently smooth, but is less robust when there is not enough smoothness present. We believe the plug-in rule is the best of those currently available, but there is still room for improvement.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a new kernel-based approach for linear system identification of stable systems. We model the impulse response as the realization of a Gaussian process whose statistics, differently from previously adopted priors, include information not only on smoothness but also on BIBO-stability. The associated autocovariance defines what we call a stable spline kernel. The corresponding minimum variance estimate belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space which is spectrally characterized. Compared to parametric identification techniques, the impulse response of the system is searched for within an infinite-dimensional space, dense in the space of continuous functions. Overparametrization is avoided by tuning few hyperparameters via marginal likelihood maximization. The proposed approach may prove particularly useful in the context of robust identification in order to obtain reduced order models by exploiting a two-step procedure that projects the nonparametric estimate onto the space of nominal models. The continuous-time derivation immediately extends to the discrete-time case. On several continuous- and discrete-time benchmarks taken from the literature the proposed approach compares very favorably with the existing parametric and nonparametric techniques. },

The paper also studies the asymptotic (the number of data points going to infinity) behavior of the GTLS and BTLS estimators when the exact noise covariance matrix is replaced by the sample noise covariance matrix obtained from a (small) number of independent data sets. Even if only two independent repeated observations are available, it is shown that the estimates are still strongly consistent without any increase in the asymptotic uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {When identifying continuous-time systems in the Laplace domain, it is indispensable to scale the frequency axis to guarantee the numerical stability of the normal equations. Without scaling, identification in the Laplace domain is often impossible even for modest model orders of the transfer function. Although the optimal scaling depends on the system, the model, and the excitation signal, the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum angular frequencies in the frequency band of interest is commonly used as a good compromise as shown in the following references: J. Schoukens and R. Pintelon, Identification of Linear Systems: A Practical Guideline to Accurate Modeling (London, U.K.: Pergamon), R. Pintelon and J. Schoukens, System Identification: A Frequency Domain Approach, (Piscataway, NJ: IEEE Press, 2001), and I. Kolla{\'{}}r, R. Pintelon, Y. Rolain, J. Schoukens, G.

System Identification, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, Aug. 27-29, 2003, 1502-1506. We show: 1) that the optimal frequency scaling also strongly depends on the estimation algorithm and 2) that the median of the angular frequencies is a better compromise for improving the numerical stability than the arithmetic mean.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Real life problems are always more complicated than expected. What is thought to be a generalised output error stochastic problem (known input, noisy output observations) of a linear system operating in open loop is often an errors-in-variables stochastic problem (noisy input, noisy output observations) of a nonlinear system operating in feedback. In addition, for lowly damped systems a ``large'' data set can still be ``short'' compared with the length of the impulse response of the system. The free-free vibrations of an aluminium tooling plate presented in this benchmark problem combine all these difficulties. The benchmark data are available at the {IFAC} TC1.1 repository},

  Abstract                 = {Frequency domain methods are known to suffer from a poor numerical conditioning when the frequency span and/or the model order become large (more than 2 decades and an order more than 20). This numerical problem ruins both the modeling performance and the model order selection capability. This paper presents a modeling approach that leads to (almost) optimal numerical conditioning of the normal equations (condition number = 1). The key idea is to expand the numerator and denominator of the transfer function model in a vector orthogonal basis. The theory is illustrated on a real measurement example.},

The frequency content of the input/output samples covers uniformly the whole unit circle in a natural way, even in case of prefiltering. Recently, the classical time domain Box--Jenkins framework has been extended to frequency domain data captured in open loop. The proposed frequency domain maximum likelihood (ML) solution can handle (i) discrete-time models using data that only covers a part of the unit circle, and (ii) continuous-time models. Part I of this series of two papers (i) generalizes the frequency domain \{ML\} solution to the closed loop case, and (ii) proves the properties of the \{ML\} estimator under non-standard conditions. Contrary to the classical time domain case it is shown that the controller should be either known or estimated. The proposed \{ML\} estimators are applicable to frequency domain data as well as time domain data.},

  Abstract                 = {For two independent binomial proportions Barnard (1947) has introduced a method to construct a non-asymptotic unconditional test by maximisation of the probabilities over the `classical' null hypothesis H0= {({\^{I}}{\c{}}1, {\^{I}}{\c{}}2) {\^{a}} [0, 1]2: {\^{I}}{\c{}}1 = {\^{I}}{\c{}}2}. It is shown that this method is also useful when studying test problems for different null hypotheses such as, for example, shifted null hypotheses of the form H0 = {($\theta_1$, $\theta_2$) a [0, 1]2: {\^{I}}{\c{}}2 {\^{a}}{\textcurrency} {\^{I}}{\c{}}1 {\^{A}}$\pm$ {\^{I}}'' } for non-inferiority and 1-sided superiority problems (including the classical null hypothesis with a 1-sided alternative hypothesis). We will derive some results for the more general {\^{a}}shifted{\^{a}} null hypotheses of the form H0 = {({\^{I}}{\c{}}1, {\^{I}}{\c{}}2) {\^{a}} [0, 1]2: {\^{I}}{\c{}}2 {\^{a}}{\textcurrency} g({\^{I}}{\c{}}1 )} where g is a non decreasing curvilinear function of {\^{I}}{\c{}}1. Two examples for such null hypotheses in the regulatory setting are given. It is shown that the usual asymptotic approximations by the normal distribution may be quite unreliable. Non-asymptotic unconditional tests (and the corresponding p-values) may, therefore, be an alternative, particularly because the effort to compute non-asymptotic unconditional p-values for such more complex situations does not increase as compared to the classical situation. For {\^{a}}classical{\^{a}} null hypotheses it is known that the number of possible p-values derived by the unconditional method is very large, albeit finite, and the same is true for the null hypotheses studied in this paper. In most of the situations investigated it becomes obvious that Barnard's CSM test (1947) when adapted to the respective null space is again a very powerful test. A theorem is provided which in addition to allowing fast algorithms to compute unconditional non-asymptotical p-values fills a methodological gap in the calculation of exact unconditional p-values as it is implemented, for example, in StatXact 3 for Windows (1995).},

Under some weak conditions, the new criterion is shown to be strongly consistent in the sense that with probability one, for all large n, the criterion chooses the smallest true model. The penalty function denoted by Cn depends on the sample size n and is chosen to ensure the consistency in the selection of true model. There are various choices of Cn suggested in the literature on model selection. In this paper we show that a particular choice of Cn based on observed data, which makes it random, preserves the consistency property and provides improved performance over a fixed choice of Cn. },

  Abstract                 = {Identification for robust control must deliver not only a nominal model, but also a reliable estimate of the uncertainty associated with the model. This paper addresses recent approaches to robust identification, that aim at dealing with contributions from the two main uncertainty sources: unmodeled dynamics and noise affecting the data. In particular, non-stationary Stochastic Embedding, Model Error Modeling based on prediction error methods and Set Membership Identification are considered. Moreover, we show how Set Membership Identification can be embedded into a Model Error Modeling framework. Model validation issues are easily addressed in the proposed framework. A discussion of asymptotic properties of all methods is presented. For all three methods, uncertainty is evaluated in terms of the frequency response, so that it can be handled by H{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\v{z}} control techniques. An example, where a nontrivial undermodeling is ensured by the presence of a nonlinearity in the system generating the data, is presented to compare these methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Distillation is one of the most common separation techniques in chemical manufacturing. This multi-input, multi-output staged separation process is strongly interactive, as determined by the singular value decomposition of a linear dynamic model of the system. Process dynamics associated with the low-gain direction are critical to the design of high-performance controllers for high-purity distillation but are difficult to estimate from conventional experimental test signals for identification. As a result, high-purity distillation columns are considered challenging cases for multivariable system identification and robust control system design. High-purity distillation is a challenging process application for system identification because of its nonlinear and strongly interactive dynamics. This article has described several constrained-optimization-based formulations for multisine input signal design that allow users to simultaneously specify the essential frequency- and time-domain properties of these signals. Because constraints are explicitly part of the design procedure, the approach is useful for accomplishing plant-friendly identification testing in the process industries. The problem formulations were evaluated for a highly nonlinear methanol-ethanol distillation column. Introducing directional sinusoids in the multisine signal, applying a closed-loop signal design, and minimizing an objective function based on Weyl's theorem enhanced the information content of the low-gain direction in the identification experiment.},

Specifically, we formulate the robust experiment design problem utilizing fundamental limitations on the variance of estimated parametric models as constraints. Using this formulation we design an input signal for situations where only diffuse a priori information is known about the system. Furthermore, we present a robust version of the unprejudiced optimal input design problem. To achieve this, we first develop a closed form solution for the input spectrum which minimizes the maximum weighted integral of the variance of the frequency response estimate over all model structures.}

Further, the l2 gain estimates by using these methods are compared in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness against noise by numerical experiments.},

The difference between the absolute magnitudes of the actual function and the polynomial ratio is the error considered. The polynomial coefficients are evaluated as the result of minimizing the sum of the squares of the above errors at the experimental points. The polynomial coefficients are computed numerically using an IBM 704 FORTRAN program. The magnitude and phase angle of the transfer function are evaluated at the various frequencies, using the computed polynomial ratio; and are compared with the observed data. The method presented here gives an analytic description of the complex transfer function superior to that given by minimization of the "weighted" sum of the squares of the errors in magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {The bioimpedance measurement/identification of time-varying biological systems Z (ω, t ) by means of electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is still a challenge today. This paper presents a novel measurement and identification approach, the so-called parametric-in-time approach, valid for time-varying (bio-)impedance systems with a (quasi) periodic character. The technique is based on multisine EIS. Contrary to the widely used nonparametric-in-time strategy, the (bio-)impedance Z (ω, t ) is assumed to be time-variant during the measurement interval. Therefore, time-varying spectral analysis tools are required. This new parametric-in-time measuring/identification technique has experimentally been validated through three independent sets of in situ measurements of in vivo myocardial impedance. We show that the time-varying myocardial impedance Z (ω, t ) is dominantly periodically time varying (PTV), denoted as Z PTV (ω, t ). From the temporal analysis of Z PTV (ω, t ), we demonstrate that it is possible to decompose Z PTV (ω, t ) into a(n) (in)finite sum of fundamental (bio-)impedance spectra, the so-called harmonic impedance spectra (HIS) Z k (ω)s with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0967-3334/34/3/339/pm450169ieqn1.gif] {$k\in \mathbb {Z}$} . This is similar to the well-known Fourier series of a periodic signal, but now understood at the level of a periodic system’s frequency response. The HIS Z k (ω)s for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0967-3334/34/3/339/pm450169ieqn2.gif] {$k\in \mathbb {Z} \backslash \lbrace 0\rbrace$} actually summarize in the bi-frequency (ω, k ) domain all the temporal in-cycle information about the periodic changes of Z (ω, t ). For the particular case k = 0 (i.e. on the ω-axis), Z 0 (ω) reflects the mean in-cycle behavior of the time-varying bioimpedance. Finally, the HIS Z k (ω)s are directly identified from noisy current and voltage myocardium measurements at the multisine measurement frequencies (i.e. nonparametric-in-frequency).},

No synchronization between the generator and the data acquisition is needed, different sampling rates are allowed (no integer number of samples/period is required).},

The analysis is based on the recent insight that leakage errors in the frequency domain have a smooth nature that is completely similar to the initial transients in the time domain. This not only allows us to understand better the existing classic methods, but also opens the road to new better performing algorithms. The paper includes the output error setup, the errors-in-variables setup, and measurements under feedback conditions. Eventually, some of the methods are illustrated in the analysis of a vibrating metal beam. },

  Abstract                 = {Frequency response function (FRF) measurements take a central place in the instrumentation and measurement field because many measurement problems boil down to the characterization of a linear dynamic behavior. The major problems to be faced are leakage and noise errors. The local polynomial method (LPM) was recently presented as a superior method to reduce the leakage errors with several orders of magnitude while the noise sensitivity remained the same as that of the classical windowing methods. The kernel idea of the LPM is a local polynomial approximation of the FRF and the leakage errors in a small-frequency band around the frequency where the FRF is estimated. Polynomial approximation of FRFs is also present in other measurement and design problems. For that reason, it is important to have a good understanding of the factors that influence the polynomial approximation errors. This article presents a full analysis of this problem and delivers a rule of thumb that can be easily applied in practice to deliver an upper bound on the approximation error of FRFs. It is shown that the approximation error for lowly damped systems is bounded by $(B_{LPM}/B_{3dB})^{R + 2}$ with $B_{LPM}$ the local bandwidth of the LPM, $R$ the degree of the local polynomial that is selected to be even (user choices), and $B_{3dB}$ the 3 dB bandwidth of the resonance, which is a system property.},

The popular leave-one-out cross-validation method, which is asymptotically equivalent to many other model selection methods such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Cp, and the bootstrap, is asymptotically inconsistent in the sense that the probability of selecting the model with the best predictive ability does not converge to 1 as the total number of observations n $\rightarrow$ $\infty$. We show that the inconsistency of the leave-one-out cross-validation can be rectified by using a leave-n$\nu$-out cross-validation with n$\nu$, the number of observations reserved for validation, satisfying n$\nu$/n $\rightarrow$ 1 as n $\rightarrow$ $\infty$. This is a somewhat shocking discovery, because n$\nu$/n $\rightarrow$ 1 is totally opposite to the popular leave-one-out recipe in cross-validation. Motivations, justifications, and discussions of some practical aspects of the use of the leave-n$\nu$-out cross-validation method are provided, and results from a simulation study are presented.},

In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conﬂation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientiﬁc knowledge.
While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

Using a fractional period of the excitation signal instead of full periods may affect not only the precision because of the well-known leakage effect, but may cause a serious loss of information on the measured system as well. The power of the excitation signal in certain frequency bands may be much lower (30-40 dB) than it would be expected, and thus the measurement in a noisy environment may give poor result. A solution is presented here to make periodic broadband (multisine) excitation signals more robust against such misuse. The suggested solution is analyzed, and the theoretical results are verified by practical examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the main components of autonomous scientific discovery, and how they lead to the concept of a Robot Scientist. This is a system which uses techniques from artificial intelligence to automate all aspects of the scientific discovery process: it generates hypotheses from a computer model of the domain, designs experiments to test these hypotheses, runs the physical experiments using robotic systems, analyses and interprets the resulting data, and repeats the cycle. We describe our two prototype Robot Scientists: Adam and Eve. Adam has recently proven the potential of such systems by identifying twelve genes responsible for catalysing specific reactions in the metabolic pathways of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This work has been formally recorded in great detail using logic. We argue that the reporting of science needs to become fully formalised and that Robot Scientists can help achieve this. This will make scientific information more reproducible and reusable, and promote the integration of computers in scientific reasoning. We believe the greater automation of both the physical and intellectual aspects of scientific investigations to be essential to the future of science. Greater automation improves the accuracy and reliability of experiments, increases the pace of discovery and, in common with conventional laboratory automation, removes tedious and repetitive tasks from the human scientist.},

  Abstract                 = {In the theory of Pad{\'{e}} approximation locally uniform convergence has been proved only for special classes of functions: for much larger classes convergence in capacity has been shown to hold true. The reason for one type of convergence to hold true, but the other one not, can be found in poles of the approximants that may occur apparently anywhere in the complex plane. Because of their unwanted nature and since they do not correspond to singularities of the function f to be approximated, these poles are called spurious. The denominators of Pad{\'{e}} approximants satisfy orthogonality relations, and consequently the location and distribution of spurious poles depend on properties of the orthogonality relations. In the present paper the possibility of spurious poles is studied from the perspective of these orthogonal relations. },

  Abstract                 = {Model predictive control, MPC, is a model-based control philosophy that select control actions by online optimization of objective functions. Design methods based on MPC have found wide acceptance in industrial process control applications, and have been thoroughly studied by the academia. Most of the work so far have relied on linear models of different sophistication because of their advantage of providing simple and straightforward implementations. However, when turning to the nonlinear domain, problems often arise as a consequence of the difficulties in obtaining good nonlinear models, and the computational burden associated with the control optimization. In this paper we present a new approach to the nonlinear MPC problem using the recently proposed concept of model-on-demand. The idea is to estimate the process dynamics locally and online using process data stored in a database. By treating the local model obtained at each sample time as a local linearization, it is thus possible to reuse tools and concepts from the linear MPC framework. Three different variants of the idea, based on local linearization, linearization along a trajectory and nonlinear optimization respectively, are studied. They are all illustrated in numerical simulations},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear systems has previously received a new impetus with the introduction of the state-space (SS) approach based on subspace approximations. This approach has immediately gained popularity, owing to the fact that it avoids the use of canonical forms, requires the determination of only one structural parameter, and has been empirically shown to yield MIMO models with good accuracy in many cases, However, the SS approach suffers from several drawbacks: there is no well-established rule tied to this approach for determining the structural parameter, and, perhaps more important the SS parameter estimates depend on the data in a rather complicated way, which renders almost futile any attempt to analyze and optimize the performance of the estimator. In this paper, we consider a transfer function (TF) approach based on instrumental variables (IV), as an alternative to the SS approach. We use the simplest canonical TF parameterization in which the denominator is equal to a scalar polynomial times the identity matrix. The analysis and optimization of the statistical accuracy of the TF approach is straightforward. Additionally, a simple test tailored to this approach is devised for estimating the single structural parameter needed. A simulation study, in which we compare the performances of the SS and the TF approaches, shows that the latter can provide more accurate models than the former at a lower computational cost},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a nonparametric method to measure an improved frequency response function (FRF) of a linear dynamic system excited by a random input. Recently, the local polynomial method (LPM) has been proposed as a technique to reduce the leakage errors on FRF measurements. The noise sensitivity of the LPM was similar to that of the classical windowing methods, while the leakage rejection is improved from an O(N-1) to an O(N-3). This paper shows a methodology, to automatically tune the parameter of the LPM, viz., the local bandwidth that sets how many neighboring frequency lines are combined in a single-point estimate, to get lower noise sensitivity by increasing the smoothening of the original LPM, without any user interaction. The balance between noise reduction and bias error will be automatically retrieved.},

The fact that normalized plant factors are estimated gives specific advantages both from an identification and from a robust control design point of view. It will be shown that the proposed method leads to identified models that are specifically accurate around the bandwidth of the closed loop system. The identification procedure fits very naturally into a recently developed the iterative identification/control design scheme based on $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {his book introduces the so-called "stable factorization approach" to the synthesis of feedback controllers for linear control systems. The key to this approach is to view the multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) plant for which one wishes to design a controller as a matrix over the fraction field F associated with a commutative ring with identity, denoted by R, which also has no divisors of zero. In this setting, the set of single-input, single-output (SISO) stable control systems is precisely the ring R, while the set of stable MIMO control systems is the set of matrices whose elements all belong to R. The set of unstable, meaning not necessarily stable, control systems is then taken to be the field of fractions F associated with R in the SISO case, and the set of matrices with elements in F in the MIMO case. The central notion introduced in the book is that, in most situations of practical interest, every matrix P whose elements belong to F can be "factored" as a "ratio" of two matrices N,D whose elements belong to R, in such a way that N,D are coprime. In the familiar case where the ring R corresponds to the set of bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO)-stable rational transfer functions, coprimeness is equivalent to two functions not having any common zeros in the closed right half-plane including infinity. However, the notion of coprimeness extends readily to discrete-time systems, distributed-parameter systems in both the continuous- as well as discrete-time domains, and to multi-dimensional systems. Thus the stable factorization approach enables one to capture all these situations within a common framework.
The key result in the stable factorization approach is the parametrization of all controllers that stabilize a given plant. It is shown that the set of all stabilizing controllers can be parametrized by a single parameter R, whose elements all belong to R. Moreover, every transfer matrix in the closed-loop system is an affine function of the design parameter R. Thus problems of reliable stabilization, disturbance rejection, robust stabilization etc. can all be formulated in terms of choosing an appropriate R.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper an identification problem is solved which is directed towards the use of the identified model as a basis for robust control design. A procedure is presented to identify, on the basis of time domain measurement data, a reduced order finite impulse response (FIR) model together with an upper bound on the model error of the corresponding transfer function, using only minor prior information. We assume the measurement data to be contaminated with a stochastic noise disturbance with unknown spectral properties. By applying a procedure similar to Bartlett's procedure of periodogram averaging, in conjunction with a periodic input signal, the statistics of the model error asymptotically can be obtained from the data. The model error consists of two parts: a probabilistic part, due to the stochastic noise disturbance, and a worst-case part, due to the unmodelled dynamics. The latter is explicitly bounded with a hard error bound, while for the former a confidence interval can be specified asymptotically. This enables an explicit trade-off between undermodelling (bias) and variance terms. The resulting error bound appears to be tight.},

Until recently, solutions to the optimal experiment design problem were paradoxical in so far that the optimal experiment depended on the system parameters, i.e. the optimal experiment depended on the very thing that the experiment was aimed at finding. In a recent paper, we proposed an alternative approach, robust in nature, to the experiment design problem which, inter-alia, allowed for the possibility that the true parameters lay in a convex set. Here we further explore this robust solution. In particular, we examine the role played by different design criteria},

An example is a battery; when subjected to a constant charge or discharge current the voltage will continuously increase or decrease until the cell reaches its maximum/minimum cut-off voltage and not reach a steady-state value. Frequency response estimation techniques that minimises leakage errors lead to significant errors at low frequencies of the response. This paper develops and presents a technique whereby the low frequency errors are eliminated. The technique is applied over the frequencies of interest, except \{DC\} frequency, and gives better results over windowing and a local polynomial frequency response estimation method. As such, an accurate low frequency response and noise power spectrum can now be obtained which in turn can be used for estimating accurate parametric models. },

Due to the TF localization property of chirp signals, a large amount of additive white noise can be reduced, and therefore, the SNR before identification can be significantly increased. This, however, cannot be achieved in the conventional methods, where pseudo-random signals are used, and therefore, noise reduction techniques do not apply. Our simulation results indicate that the method proposed outperforms the conventional methods significantly in a low SNR environment.

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the active isolation of a system containing a distributed parameter isolator using absolute velocity feedback control. The main differences between this type of system and one with a massless isolator, is that there are isolator resonances. It is shown that the vibration at these resonance frequencies cannot be suppressed using a simple velocity feedback control strategy. Moreover, it is found that the isolator resonances can cause the control system to become unstable, if the isolated equipment is supported on a flexible base. A stability criterion based on the mode shapes of the system is presented. Two techniques to stabilise the system are investigated and compared. The first involves the addition of mass on the base structure, and the second involves an electronic lead compensator. Experimental results are presented to support the theoretical findings. It is shown that even if the instability due to the isolator resonances and flexibility of the base can be prevented, the instability due to the flexibility of the equipment remains a problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Model order reduction is an efficient technique to reduce the system complexity while producing a good approximation of the input-output behavior. However, the efficiency of reduction degrades as the number of ports increases, which remains a long-standing problem. The reason for the degradation is that existing approaches are based on a centralized framework, where each input-output pair is implicitly assumed to be equally interacted and the matrix-valued transfer function has to be assumed to be fully populated. In this paper, a decentralized model order reduction scheme is proposed, where a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system is decoupled into a number of subsystems and each subsystem corresponds to one output and several dominant inputs. The decoupling process is based on the relative gain array (RGA), which measures the degree of interaction of each input-output pair. Our experimental results on a number of interconnect circuits show that most of the input- output interactions are usually insignificant, which can lead to extremely compact models even for systems with massive ports. The reduction scheme is very amenable for parallel computing as each decoupled subsystem can be reduced independently.},

The present paper argues, on commonsense grounds, supported by simple examples, that these attacks are misconceived, and are mainly due to uncritical acceptance of the Neyman-Pearson approach to tests of significance, the use of nominal levels, and refusal to accept the arguments for conditioning on the margins. Two-sided tests have also added to the confusion; it is argued that the best definition of a two-sided probability is twice the observed one-tail probability.},

However, small variations in the performed task may lead to a large performance deterioration. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel \{ILC\} approach, by exploiting rational basis functions, that enables performance enhancement through iterative learning while providing flexibility with respect to task variations. The proposed approach involves an iterative optimization procedure after each task, that exploits recent developments in instrumental variable-based system identification. Enhanced performance compared to pre-existing results is proven theoretically and illustrated through simulation examples. },
