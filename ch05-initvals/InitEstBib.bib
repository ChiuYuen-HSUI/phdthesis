  Abstract                 = {Abstract There has been recently a trend to study linear system identification with high order finite impulse response (FIR) models using the regularized least-squares approach. One key of this approach is to solve the hyper-parameter estimation problem that is usually nonconvex. Our goal here is to investigate implementation of algorithms for solving the hyper-parameter estimation problem that can deal with both large data sets and possibly ill-conditioned computations. In particular, a \{QR\} factorization based matrix-inversion-free algorithm is proposed to evaluate the cost function in an efficient and accurate way. It is also shown that the gradient and Hessian of the cost function can be computed based on the same \{QR\} factorization. Finally, the proposed algorithm and ideas are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations on a large data-bank of test systems and data sets.},

@article{Pillonetto201081,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a new kernel-based approach for linear system identification of stable systems. We model the impulse response as the realization of a Gaussian process whose statistics, differently from previously adopted priors, include information not only on smoothness but also on BIBO-stability. The associated autocovariance defines what we call a stable spline kernel. The corresponding minimum variance estimate belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space which is spectrally characterized. Compared to parametric identification techniques, the impulse response of the system is searched for within an infinite-dimensional space, dense in the space of continuous functions. Overparametrization is avoided by tuning few hyperparameters via marginal likelihood maximization. The proposed approach may prove particularly useful in the context of robust identification in order to obtain reduced order models by exploiting a two-step procedure that projects the nonparametric estimate onto the space of nominal models. The continuous-time derivation immediately extends to the discrete-time case. On several continuous- and discrete-time benchmarks taken from the literature the proposed approach compares very favorably with the existing parametric and nonparametric techniques. },

@article{Chen20121525,
	Abstract = {Intrigued by some recent results on impulse response estimation by kernel and nonparametric techniques, we revisit the old problem of transfer function estimation from input--output measurements. We formulate a classical regularization approach, focused on finite impulse response (FIR) models, and find that regularization is necessary to cope with the high variance problem. This basic, regularized least squares approach is then a focal point for interpreting other techniques, like Bayesian inference and Gaussian process regression. The main issue is how to determine a suitable regularization matrix (Bayesian prior or kernel). Several regularization matrices are provided and numerically evaluated on a data bank of test systems and data sets. Our findings based on the data bank are as follows. The classical regularization approach with carefully chosen regularization matrices shows slightly better accuracy and clearly better robustness in estimating the impulse response than the standard approach--the prediction error method/maximum likelihood (PEM/ML) approach. If the goal is to estimate a model of given order as well as possible, a low order model is often better estimated by the PEM/ML approach, and a higher order model is often better estimated by model reduction on a high order regularized \{FIR\} model estimated with careful regularization. Moreover, an optimal regularization matrix that minimizes the mean square error matrix is derived and studied. The importance of this result lies in that it gives the theoretical upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved for this classical regularization approach. },

	Abstract = {Interturn winding faults are one of the most prevalent and potentially
	destructive electrical faults in power transformers. This contribution
	is an initiative to explore the potential of the sweep frequency
	response analysis (SFRA) method in detecting interturn winding faults
	and also identifying the most appropriate measurement configuration
	for making sensitive frequency response measurements. This application
	enables timely warning of the rising failure and so is of particular
	importance, as these kinds of defects, if left undetected, can propagate
	and lead to catastrophic phase--ground or phase--phase faults which
	can finally cause the breakdown of the whole transformer. In this
	paper contribution is made to a better understanding of the transformer
	performance and modification of the transformer winding frequency
	response in the presence of interturn faults. The paper includes
	a full description of the details of the SFRA method and measuring
	procedure, along with principal experiments conducted on a 100 kVA
	distribution transformer. A large number of measurements with different
	transfer functions, various terminal configurations and three categories
	of measurement types was conducted to identify the most appropriate
	configuration for making SFRA measurements. The experimental results
	proved that the identified measurement configuration is sensitive
	to detect unambiguously interturn faults even down to 0.2% shorted
	turns along the winding.},

	Abstract = {{The response of a linear time-invariant process on a stochastic input
	signal is characterized by the transfer function, Unknown past inputs
	and future output are sources of inaccuracy in relating a finite
	segment of an output signal via an estimated transfer function to
	the corresponding input segment, These end effects are usually characterized
	with error bounds on the Fourier transform of the output signal,
	but the error in an estimated transfer function can be quantified
	more precisely in terms of bias and variance. The accuracy of three
	transfer function estimators is compared, showing an infinite variance
	for the Experimental Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE) and a better
	efficiency for the estimators which are based on the cross spectrum.
	The variance due to additive noise depends on whether the input is
	a stochastic or a deterministic signal.}},

	Abstract = {{Front-end electronics (FEEs) with a trigger function typically involve
	a diverged interconnect, which transfers signals from an amplifier
	block to both a magnitude acquisition block and a timing acquisition
	block. The FEE suffers from inherent reflection due to the impedance
	mismatch at the diverged interconnect, particularly in high-speed
	applications. In this paper, the effects of the diverged interconnect
	in the FEE are analyzed in the frequency domain. A transfer function
	of the FEE is derived, and the frequency responses are estimated
	under diverse characteristic impedance and termination conditions
	of the diverged interconnect. The estimated results are confirmed
	by performing experiments with test circuits. It can be observed
	that the frequency range where the frequency response is distorted
	becomes lower with the increase in the width of the diverged interconnect
	and its termination capacitance, which corresponded to the input
	capacitance of the trigger circuit.}},

	a problem is the identification of a system in a feedback loop. It
	is known that this problem can be solved using errors-in-variables
	methods if the covariance matrices of the disturbing noise (on input
	and output measurements) are a priori known. It is shown that the
	exact covariance matrices can be replaced by the sample covariance
	matrices: the system can be identified from the sample means and
	sample covariance matrices calculated from a (small) number M of
	independently repeated experiments. It is shown that under these
	conditions the estimates are still strongly consistent for an increasing
	number of data points N in each experiment (N --> [infinity]) if
