	Abstract = {Interturn winding faults are one of the most prevalent and potentially destructive electrical faults in power transformers. This contribution is an initiative to explore the potential of the sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA) method in detecting interturn winding faults and also identifying the most appropriate measurement configuration for making sensitive frequency response measurements. This application enables timely warning of the rising failure and so is of particular importance, as these kinds of defects, if left undetected, can propagate and lead to catastrophic phase--ground or phase--phase faults which can finally cause the breakdown of the whole transformer. In this paper contribution is made to a better understanding of the transformer performance and modification of the transformer winding frequency response in the presence of interturn faults. The paper includes a full description of the details of the SFRA method and measuring procedure, along with principal experiments conducted on a 100 kVA distribution transformer. A large number of measurements with different transfer functions, various terminal configurations and three categories of measurement types was conducted to identify the most appropriate configuration for making SFRA measurements. The experimental results proved that the identified measurement configuration is sensitive to detect unambiguously interturn faults even down to 0.2% shorted turns along the winding.},

@article{Lim2010,
	Abstract = {{Front-end electronics (FEEs) with a trigger function typically involve a
   diverged interconnect, which transfers signals from an amplifier block
   to both a magnitude acquisition block and a timing acquisition block.
   The FEE suffers from inherent reflection due to the impedance mismatch
   at the diverged interconnect, particularly in high-speed applications.
   In this paper, the effects of the diverged interconnect in the FEE are
   analyzed in the frequency domain. A transfer function of the FEE is
   derived, and the frequency responses are estimated under diverse
   characteristic impedance and termination conditions of the diverged
   interconnect. The estimated results are confirmed by performing
   experiments with test circuits. It can be observed that the frequency
   range where the frequency response is distorted becomes lower with the
   increase in the width of the diverged interconnect and its termination
   capacitance, which corresponded to the input capacitance of the trigger
   circuit.}},

	Abstract = {{This paper investigates the measurement errors involved in estimating
   frequency response functions (FRFs)-and related quantities such as the
   coherence function-from weighted overlapped segment averaging, a
   technique that has become a standard in modern data analyzers due to its
   computational advantages. Particular attention is paid to leakage
   errors, for which this technique has frequently been criticized. Our
   main result is that a half-sine or diff window with about 2/3 overlap
   achieves the best compromise to reduce leakage errors in the case of
   stationary random excitations, and this is independently of the system
   FRF. This conclusion is to be contrasted with the customary habit of
   using a Hanning window with 1/2 overlap. The same reasoning confirms
   that a rectangular window without overlap minimizes measurement errors
   in the special case of multisine excitations. Moreover, practical
   formulas are provided to the reader for computing the bias and variance

   frequency response function (FRF) of a linear dynamic system excited by
   a random input. Recently, the local polynomial method (LPM) has been
   proposed as a technique to reduce the leakage errors on FRF
   measurements. The noise sensitivity of the LPM was similar to that of
   the classical windowing methods, while the leakage rejection is improved
   from an O(N-1) to an O(N-3). This paper shows a methodology, to
   automatically tune the parameter of the LPM, viz., the local bandwidth
   that sets how many neighboring frequency lines are combined in a
   single-point estimate, to get lower noise sensitivity by increasing the
   smoothening of the original LPM, without any user interaction. The
   balance between noise reduction and bias error will be automatically
   retrieved.}},

	frequency response functions from weighted-overlapped segment averaging,
	a technique that has become a standard in modern spectral analysers

	to leakage errors, for which this procedure has been frequently criticised.
	Exact and asymptotic expressions for the bias and variance are provided,
	whose minimisation enables the derivation of the optimal settings
	to be used with this procedure. Our main finding is that a Half-sine

	response function. This conclusion is to be contrasted with the customary
	habit of using a Hanning window with overlap.},

	the frequency data when the measurements of the input and the output
	signals are both disturbed with noise. A typical example of such
	a problem is the identification of a system in a feedback loop. It
	is known that this problem can be solved using errors-in-variables
	methods if the covariance matrices of the disturbing noise (on input
	and output measurements) are a priori known. It is shown that the
	exact covariance matrices can be replaced by the sample covariance
	matrices: the system can be identified from the sample means and
	sample covariance matrices calculated from a (small) number M of
	independently repeated experiments. It is shown that under these
	conditions the estimates are still strongly consistent for an increasing
	number of data points N in each experiment (N --> [infinity]) if
	M >= 4. The loss in efficiency is quantified (M >= 6), and the expected
	value of the cost function (M >= 4) and its variance (M >= 6) are

	a transient error due to initial and end condition effects, and an
	interpolation error due to the combination of neighbouring spectral
	lines. Starting from these insights an extremely simple expression
