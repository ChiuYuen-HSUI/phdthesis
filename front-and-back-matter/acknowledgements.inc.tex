While the preparation of a PhD is for a large part an endeavor of a single person, it is by no means a solitary experience.
Research without collaboration is unthinkable and is unlikely to yield new scientific and technical insights since personal interactions allow new ideas and applications to germinate.

In the first place, I would like to thank my colleagues at the ELEC department for being an outgoing group that has been combining a fond interest for engineering and leisure.
In particular, I am grateful for the great atmosphere in my office and for my office mates over the last few years: Adam, Anna, David, Diane, Ebrahim, Erlyiang, Francesco, Gustavo, Hannes, Maarten, Mark, Matthias, and Maulik (though not all at the same time).

And last but not least, I would like to thank our cat Pixie for being an enjoyably crazy critter and for his enthusiasm when bringing home little presents and leaving them either on the floor or even on my pillow while I'm fast asleep.
His intent has been duly noted and appreciated (the nightly hours and contents of those presents, however, were not always equally well-received).
